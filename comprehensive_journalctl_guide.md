## 1. Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of `journalctl` is:
```bash
journalctl [options]
```
- **options**: Flags to filter or customize the log output.

> **Note**: Viewing system logs with `journalctl` often requires `sudo` privileges.

## 2. Viewing All Logs

By default, `journalctl` displays the entire system log.

- **Example**: Display all system logs.
  ```bash
  sudo journalctl
  ```

Use `Ctrl+C` to stop viewing logs and return to the terminal.

## 3. Filtering by Date and Time

You can filter logs by specific dates and times using `--since` and `--until`.

- **Example**: View logs since a specific date.
  ```bash
  sudo journalctl --since "2023-01-01 08:00:00"
  ```

- **Example**: View logs from a time range.
  ```bash
  sudo journalctl --since "2023-01-01" --until "2023-01-02"
  ```

## 4. Filtering by Service

Use the `-u` option to view logs for a specific service.

- **Example**: View logs for the `apache2` service.
  ```bash
  sudo journalctl -u apache2
  ```

- **Example**: View logs for `apache2` since boot.
  ```bash
  sudo journalctl -u apache2 -b
  ```

## 5. Viewing Logs by Priority Level

Log messages in `journalctl` have priority levels (e.g., error, warning, info). Use `-p` to filter by priority.

- **Example**: Show only error and critical messages.
  ```bash
  sudo journalctl -p err
  ```

- **Example**: Show warning and higher priority logs.
  ```bash
  sudo journalctl -p warning
  ```

### Priority Levels

- **emerg (0)**: Emergency
- **alert (1)**: Alert
- **crit (2)**: Critical
- **err (3)**: Error
- **warning (4)**: Warning
- **notice (5)**: Notice
- **info (6)**: Informational
- **debug (7)**: Debugging

## 6. Practical Use Cases

- **System Troubleshooting**: Use `journalctl` to view recent logs, filter by priority, and isolate issues quickly.
- **Service Monitoring**: Check logs for specific services to diagnose issues with daemons or applications.
- **Security Audits**: Examine critical and error-level logs to identify potential security incidents.
- **Performance Tuning**: Monitor system logs to detect resource-related warnings and optimize system performance.

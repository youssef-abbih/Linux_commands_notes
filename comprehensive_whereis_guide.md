## 1. Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of `whereis` is:
```bash
whereis [options] command
```
- **options**: Flags to filter results to executables, sources, or manual pages.
- **command**: The name of the command to locate.

## 2. Locating Executables, Sources, and Manuals

Running `whereis` with a command name will display the locations of its binary, source, and manual page.

- **Example**: Locate files associated with the `ls` command.
  ```bash
  whereis ls
  ```

This displays paths for the `ls` executable, source, and man pages.

## 3. Limiting Search to Specific Directories

Use the `-B`, `-M`, and `-S` options to limit the search to specific directories for binaries, manuals, and sources, respectively.

- **Example**: Search for `ls` binaries only in `/bin` and `/usr/bin`.
  ```bash
  whereis -B /bin:/usr/bin ls
  ```

## 4. Finding Only Executables, Sources, or Manuals

You can use `-b`, `-m`, and `-s` options to display only the binary, manual, or source files.

- **Example**: Show only the binary location of `ls`.
  ```bash
  whereis -b ls
  ```

- **Example**: Show only the manual page location of `ls`.
  ```bash
  whereis -m ls
  ```

## 5. Practical Use Cases

- **Quickly Locate Command Paths**: Find the path of command executables and associated files.
- **Verify Installation**: Confirm the existence and location of executables, manuals, and source files for specific commands.
- **Script Automation**: Use `whereis` in scripts to check for command availability in specified directories.

## 1. Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of `cal` is:
```bash
cal [options] [[month] year]
```
- **options**: Flags to customize the output, such as Julian dates.
- **month**: Optional, specify a month as a number (1-12).
- **year**: Optional, specify the year as a four-digit number.

> If no arguments are provided, `cal` displays the calendar for the current month.

## 2. Displaying the Current Month

To display the current month, simply run `cal` without additional options.

- **Example**: Display the calendar for the current month:
  ```bash
  cal
  ```

## 3. Displaying a Specific Month and Year

To view a calendar for a specific month and year, provide the month number and year.

- **Example**: Display the calendar for March 2025:
  ```bash
  cal 3 2025
  ```

## 4. Displaying an Entire Year

Use the `-y` option to display the calendar for the entire current year.

- **Example**: Display the full calendar for the current year:
  ```bash
  cal -y
  ```

Alternatively, specify the year without a month to show all months in that year.

- **Example**: Display the full calendar for 2024:
  ```bash
  cal 2024
  ```

## 5. Highlighting the Current Date

To highlight the current day in the calendar, use the `-3` option. This shows the previous, current, and next month with the current day highlighted.

- **Example**: Display previous, current, and next month with highlighted current day:
  ```bash
  cal -3
  ```

## 6. Using Julian Dates

Julian dates show each day of the year numbered sequentially.

- **Example**: Display the current month in Julian format:
  ```bash
  cal -j
  ```

- **Example**: Display an entire year with Julian dates:
  ```bash
  cal -jy
  ```

## 7. Practical Use Cases

- **Scheduling and Planning**: View upcoming months for event planning or checking dates.
- **Script Automation**: Use `cal` in scripts to display dates or format calendar outputs.
- **Historical Dates**: Quickly check dates from previous years for research or reference.

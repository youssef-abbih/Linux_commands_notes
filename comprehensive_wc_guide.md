## 1. Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of `wc` is:
```bash
wc [options] file
```
- **file**: The file(s) to analyze. If no file is provided, `wc` reads from standard input.

> By default, `wc` outputs the line, word, and byte counts for each file.

## 2. Counting Lines

Use the `-l` option to display only the line count.

- **Example**: Count lines in `file.txt`:
  ```bash
  wc -l file.txt
  ```

## 3. Counting Words

Use the `-w` option to display only the word count.

- **Example**: Count words in `file.txt`:
  ```bash
  wc -w file.txt
  ```

## 4. Counting Characters and Bytes

- **Characters**: Use `-m` to count the number of characters.
  ```bash
  wc -m file.txt
  ```
- **Bytes**: Use `-c` to count the number of bytes.
  ```bash
  wc -c file.txt
  ```
  > Note: The byte count may differ from the character count if the file contains multi-byte characters.

## 5. Counting Multiple Files

When multiple files are specified, `wc` provides a summary for each file and a total.

- **Example**: Count lines, words, and bytes in `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`:
  ```bash
  wc file1.txt file2.txt
  ```

## 6. Combining Options

You can combine options to display specific information.

- **Example**: Display line and word counts only:
  ```bash
  wc -l -w file.txt
  ```

Or simply list all with a single command:
```bash
wc -lmw file.txt
```

## 7. Practical Use Cases

- **File Size Analysis**: Use `wc -c` to get the byte size of files.
- **Script Output Validation**: Use `wc -l` to count the number of output lines in pipelines or scripts.
- **Log Analysis**: Use `wc -w` to check word counts in log files for tracking message or entry counts.
- **Document Summarization**: Quickly get a count of lines, words, and characters in text documents.

## 1. Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of `ps` is:
```bash
ps [options]
```
- **options**: Flags to specify the output format, filter processes, or control the information displayed.

## 2. Viewing All Processes

To view all processes running on the system, use the `aux` option.

- **Example**: Display all processes with detailed information:
  ```bash
  ps aux
  ```

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of common columns:
- **USER**: The user owning the process.
- **PID**: Process ID.
- **%CPU**: CPU usage.
- **%MEM**: Memory usage.
- **VSZ**: Virtual memory size.
- **RSS**: Resident memory size.
- **TTY**: Terminal associated with the process.
- **STAT**: Process state.
- **START**: Start time of the process.
- **TIME**: Total CPU time used.
- **COMMAND**: The command that started the process.

## 3. Displaying Full Process Information

Use the `-f` option for a full-format listing, which includes parent process ID (PPID) and other details.

- **Example**: Display full information for processes owned by the current user:
  ```bash
  ps -f
  ```

## 4. Filtering by User

To view processes owned by a specific user, use the `-u` option.

- **Example**: Show all processes run by `username`:
  ```bash
  ps -u username
  ```

Alternatively, combine `aux` and `grep` to search for a user:
```bash
ps aux | grep username
```

## 5. Sorting Processes

Use options such as `--sort` to sort processes by specific criteria.

- **Example**: Sort processes by memory usage in descending order:
  ```bash
  ps aux --sort=-%mem
  ```

- **Example**: Sort by CPU usage:
  ```bash
  ps aux --sort=-%cpu
  ```

## 6. Practical Use Cases

- **System Monitoring**: Use `ps aux` to get a complete overview of system processes.
- **Identifying Resource Hogs**: Sort processes by CPU or memory usage to find and troubleshoot resource-intensive processes.
- **User-Specific Processes**: View processes owned by a particular user to monitor user-specific activity.
- **Script Automation**: Integrate `ps` with other commands in scripts to automate process checks.

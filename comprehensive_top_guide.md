## 1. Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of `top` is:
```bash
top [options]
```
- **options**: Flags to customize the output or control the behavior of `top`.

Running `top` without options opens an interactive view of system processes and resource usage.

## 2. Understanding the Output

The default `top` display includes the following sections:

- **Summary Information**: Displays uptime, load average, total tasks, CPU usage, memory usage, and swap usage.
- **Process Table**: Shows information about each process, with columns including:
  - **PID**: Process ID.
  - **USER**: The user owning the process.
  - **PR**: Process priority.
  - **%CPU**: CPU usage.
  - **%MEM**: Memory usage.
  - **TIME+**: Total CPU time used by the process.
  - **COMMAND**: The command that started the process.

## 3. Common Keyboard Shortcuts

`top` supports various keyboard shortcuts for interactive control:

- **q**: Quit `top`.
- **h**: Display help information.
- **Space**: Refresh the display.
- **k**: Kill a process by entering its PID.
- **M**: Sort by memory usage.
- **P**: Sort by CPU usage.
- **u**: Filter by a specific user.

## 4. Filtering and Sorting Processes

You can sort and filter processes in `top`:

- **Sort by CPU**: Press **P** to sort processes by CPU usage (default).
- **Sort by Memory**: Press **M** to sort processes by memory usage.
- **Filter by User**: Press **u** and enter a username to display only that userâ€™s processes.

## 5. Customizing Display

`top` allows you to customize the display settings:

- **Fields/Columns**: Press **f** to enter the field management screen where you can choose which columns to display.
- **Display Mode**: Press **t** to toggle between full-screen and task list mode.
- **Batch Mode**: Use the `-b` option to run `top` in batch mode, which is useful for logging or scripts.
  ```bash
  top -b -n 1 > top_output.txt
  ```

## 6. Practical Use Cases

- **System Performance Monitoring**: Use `top` to monitor overall CPU and memory usage in real time.
- **Troubleshooting Resource Hogs**: Sort processes by memory or CPU usage to identify processes consuming excessive resources.
- **User-Specific Monitoring**: Filter processes by user to analyze individual user activity on shared systems.
- **Script Automation**: Use `top` in batch mode to log resource usage over time for later analysis.

## 1. Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of `bc` is:
```bash
echo "expression" | bc [options]
```
- **expression**: The arithmetic expression to be evaluated.
- **options**: Flags to control `bc` behavior, such as including a standard math library.

You can also start an interactive `bc` session by simply running `bc`.

## 2. Basic Arithmetic Operations

Use `bc` to perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- **Example**: Perform addition.
  ```bash
  echo "5 + 3" | bc
  ```

- **Example**: Multiply two numbers.
  ```bash
  echo "7 * 2" | bc
  ```

## 3. Setting Scale for Decimal Precision

The `scale` variable in `bc` controls the number of decimal places for division.

- **Example**: Set scale to 3 for decimal precision.
  ```bash
  echo "scale=3; 10 / 3" | bc
  ```

In this case, `10 / 3` will output `3.333`.

## 4. Advanced Mathematical Functions

To use functions like sine, cosine, square root, etc., use `bc -l` to enable the standard math library.

- **Example**: Calculate square root.
  ```bash
  echo "scale=2; sqrt(16)" | bc -l
  ```

- **Example**: Calculate sine of an angle (in radians).
  ```bash
  echo "scale=4; s(1)" | bc -l
  ```

## 5. Using `bc` in Shell Scripts

`bc` can be used in scripts to perform calculations.

- **Example**: Calculate the area of a circle in a script.
  ```bash
  radius=5
  area=$(echo "scale=2; 3.1415 * $radius * $radius" | bc)
  echo "Area: $area"
  ```

## 6. Practical Use Cases

- **Interactive Calculations**: Start an interactive `bc` session for quick calculations.
- **Decimal Precision Control**: Use `scale` to control precision, ideal for financial calculations.
- **Mathematical Operations in Scripts**: Automate complex calculations in shell scripts for tasks like report generation or data processing.
- **Advanced Math Functions**: Use `bc -l` for trigonometry, square roots, and logarithmic calculations.

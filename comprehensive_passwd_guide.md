## 1. Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of `passwd` is:
```bash
passwd [options] [username]
```
- **options**: Flags to control password expiration, account locking, or force password changes.
- **username**: The user account to update. If omitted, it updates the password of the current user.

> **Note**: Setting passwords for other users requires root privileges.

## 2. Changing Your Own Password

Running `passwd` without specifying a username allows users to change their own password. They will be prompted to enter their current password followed by the new password twice for confirmation.

- **Example**: Change your own password.
  ```bash
  passwd
  ```

## 3. Setting Passwords for Other Users

Administrators can specify a username to set or reset the password for another user.

- **Example**: Set a password for user `jdoe`.
  ```bash
  sudo passwd jdoe
  ```

## 4. Expiring a Password

Use the `-e` option to force a user to change their password on the next login.

- **Example**: Force `jdoe` to update their password at next login.
  ```bash
  sudo passwd -e jdoe
  ```

## 5. Locking and Unlocking Accounts

- **Lock an Account**: Use `-l` to lock a userâ€™s account, preventing them from logging in.
  ```bash
  sudo passwd -l jdoe
  ```

- **Unlock an Account**: Use `-u` to unlock a previously locked account.
  ```bash
  sudo passwd -u jdoe
  ```

## 6. Practical Use Cases

- **User-Initiated Password Changes**: Users can regularly update their passwords for better security.
- **Password Resets**: Administrators can set or reset passwords for users who forget their credentials.
- **Forced Updates**: Use password expiration to enforce password changes after a set period.
- **Account Security**: Temporarily lock accounts that are inactive or under review.

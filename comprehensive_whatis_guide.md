## 1. Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of `whatis` is:
```bash
whatis [options] keyword
```
- **options**: Flags to customize the output or search behavior.
- **keyword**: The command, function, or program to look up.

## 2. Displaying Descriptions for Commands

To retrieve a brief description of a command, simply specify the command name as the keyword.

- **Example**: Display information about the `ls` command.
  ```bash
  whatis ls
  ```

Output will include the command name, section, and a short description:
```
ls (1)               - list directory contents
```

## 3. Using Multiple Keywords

You can specify multiple keywords to get descriptions for several commands in one execution.

- **Example**: Display descriptions for `cp`, `mv`, and `rm`.
  ```bash
  whatis cp mv rm
  ```

Each command will have its own line with a description.

## 4. Refreshing the `whatis` Database

The `whatis` database may need to be updated to reflect new or updated manual pages. Use `mandb` to refresh this database.

- **Example**: Update the `whatis` database.
  ```bash
  sudo mandb
  ```

## 5. Practical Use Cases

- **Quick Command Reference**: Use `whatis` to retrieve brief descriptions of commands to understand their function without reading full man pages.
- **Script and Automation Support**: Retrieve descriptions for commands in scripts or automated documentation.
- **System Troubleshooting**: Use `whatis` in unfamiliar environments to quickly understand available commands.
- **Efficient Search**: View command descriptions for multiple keywords in a single query.
